# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

This project explores a dataset of customer behavior to determine the likelihood of coupon acceptance for various offers — such as coffee, bars, and restaurants.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Given information about a customer — like age, income, marital status, and how often they visit places — can we predict whether they’ll accept a coupon?

## 🔍 Independent Investigation

I focused on customers who were offered **Coffee House** coupons. My analysis explored whether young, frequent coffee drinkers (under 30, no kids, 4+ visits/month) are more likely to accept the coupon compared to other customers.

### Key Findings:

Younger customers who regularly go to coffee shops were significantly more likely to accept the coupon than other customer groups. This suggests that tailoring offers based on habits and demographics can meaningfully improve marketing effectiveness.
